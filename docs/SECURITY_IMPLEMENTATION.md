# Authentication Security Implementation

## Implemented Security Fixes

### Critical Fixes
1. **NoSQL Injection Protection**
   - Modified User model queries to use explicit `$eq` operator
   - Prevents injection attacks via email/username fields

2. **Enhanced JWT Security**
   - Added algorithm specification (HS256)
   - Implemented JWT ID for token uniqueness
   - Added audience and issuer claims
   - Enforced verification of these claims

3. **Stronger Password Policy**
   - Increased minimum length from 8 to 10 characters
   - Added special character requirement
   - Maintained existing lowercase, uppercase, and number requirements

4. **Improved Rate Limiting**
   - Reduced login attempts from 10 to 5 per 15 minutes
   - Added 30-minute block after exceeding limit
   - Reduced signup attempts to 3 per hour
   - Added 24-hour block after exceeding signup limit

## Security Test Script
A test script has been created at `scripts/auth-security-test.js` that verifies:
- Password policy enforcement
- NoSQL injection protection
- Successful registration with strong passwords
- Duplicate registration prevention
- JWT token validation and rejection of invalid tokens
- Rate limiting functionality

Run the test with:
```
node scripts/auth-security-test.js
```

## Implementation Plan for Additional Security Improvements

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. **CSRF Protection**
   - Install csurf: `npm install csurf`
   - Implement in server.mjs
   - Add CSRF tokens to frontend forms

2. **Account Lockout**
   - Add login attempt tracking to User model
   - Implement temporary lockout after failed attempts

3. **Refresh Token Improvements**
   - Add expiry timestamps to stored tokens
   - Implement token rotation on refresh
   - Add automatic cleanup of expired tokens

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
1. **Security Headers**
   - Enhance Helmet configuration
   - Implement strict Content-Security-Policy
   - Add Referrer-Policy and Feature-Policy headers

2. **Session Management**
   - Implement proper session storage with MongoDB
   - Add session expiry and automatic cleanup

3. **User Enumeration Prevention**
   - Standardize error messages for login failures
   - Use constant-time comparison for credentials

### Long-term (1-2 months)
1. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Implement TOTP-based 2FA
   - Add recovery codes functionality

2. **Security Logging and Monitoring**
   - Log authentication events and failures
   - Implement alerts for suspicious activity

3. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Establish automated security testing
   - Schedule periodic dependency reviews

## Required Dependencies
```
npm install --save helmet csurf express-rate-limit express-session connect-mongo
```

## Testing Methodology
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual security components
   - Verify password hashing, token generation, etc.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test authentication flow end-to-end
   - Verify rate limiting, account lockout, etc.

3. **Security Tests**
   - Test against common attack vectors
   - Verify protection against injection, CSRF, etc.

## Conclusion
The implemented security fixes address the most critical vulnerabilities in the authentication system. The remaining improvements should be implemented according to the provided timeline to ensure comprehensive security coverage.
